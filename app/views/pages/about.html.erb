        <p>Facebook checks your friends list and looks for mutual friends. These mutual friends are shown as suggestions on your timeline.

        For example, your siblings friends could be people you know. So they will be shown as “friend suggestion” on your timeline.

        But Facebook is not accurate and most of the times ends up showing random people you don’t know in friend’s suggestions.
